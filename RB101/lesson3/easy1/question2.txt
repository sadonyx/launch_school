Describe the difference between `!` and `?` in Ruby.
And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

1. what is `!=` and where should you use it? 
  This is the 'not equal' operand and is used in a conditional statement.
  If two items that are being compared are not equal, it will return true.

2. put `!` before something, like `!user_name`
  This will return the opposite truthy value of the object it precedes.

3. put `!` after something, like `words.uniq!`
  When placed at the end of a method name, it indicates that the call does NOT return
  a modified version of the object being called on, but rather modifies it in place.

4. put `?` before something
  `? :` is the ternary operator for `if...else`

5. put `?` after something
  When placed at the end of a method name, it indicates that the call will return a 
  truthy value, such as true, false, or nil.
  Answer: it is used to turn any object into the opposite of their boolean equivalent.

5. puts `!!` before something, like `!!user_name`
  `!!<some_object>` is used to turn any object into their boolean equivalent.
