# One day Spot was playing with the Munster family's home computer and he wrote a small program to mess with their demographic data:

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

def mess_with_demographics(demo_hash)
  demo_hash.values.each do |family_member|
    family_member["age"] += 42
    family_member["gender"] = "other"
  end
end

mess_with_demographics(munsters)

# In Ruby, what gets passed to a method isn't the value of the object. Under the hood, Ruby passes the object_id of each argument to the method. The method stores these object_id's internally in locally scoped (private to the method) variables (named per the method definition's parameter list). Furthermore, the hash is permenantly changed as `+=` and `=` are mutating methods.
